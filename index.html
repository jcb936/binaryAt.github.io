<p><em>(Originally written for a portfolio)</em></p>
<p>Lately, I got closer and closer to the LGBTQI+ community as an ally; I’m especially interested in the topic of anti-trans and anti-nb sentiments in the world. While I was researching into the topic of what it meant to live outside the conventional gender and sex norms I encountered many hateful comments online targeted against these minorities. <em>Binary@</em> is a fake test that will categorise you in one of two binary groups, red or blue, metaphorically representing female and male respectively. In <em>Binary@</em> there is no room for nuance or a spectrum, you are either red or blue. If you try to balance the two out and escape the conventional norms you are met with a black screen and the end of the game, showing a random hateful comment about trans and non-binary people from various online sources.</p>
